# QMC-for-Asian-option
In this repository I use quasi-Monte Carlo simulation for estimatimg price of a hypothetical asian option.  
I have compared performance of QMC simulation using 'Sobol sequence' and 'Halton sequence' and Ordinary MC in terms of
sample size they need to reach a desired precision.
